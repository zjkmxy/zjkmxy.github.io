# Vehicle Instrument Recognition

2015â€“2016

[Code](https://github.com/zjkmxy/VehicleInstruments)

This is a course project that reads the number indicated by a vehicle instrument.
We use Kirsch and Sobel operators to sharpen the image,
 Otsu algorithm for thresholding,
 and RANSEC to detect the scale marks and the hand.
We calculate the result based on the angle.
