NDN Local Forwarder Manager (NDN-FM) provides a graphical interface to increase the ease with which users can manage local instances of the NDN Forwarding Daemon (NFD) and other packet forwarders implementing the NFD Management Protocol:
NDN-FM can monitor the status of the forwarder; create, update, and delete faces and routes; manage certificates; and run basic NDN debugging tools.
