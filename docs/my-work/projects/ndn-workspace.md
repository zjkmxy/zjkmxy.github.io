NDN Workspace is a web-based, multi-user collaborative LaTeX editing app.
It is designed to demonstrate data-centric applications, built upon many-to-many secure data exchanges among communicating entities directly.
NDN Workspace users establish trust relations among each other, exchange URI-identified objects directly, and can collaborate through intermittent connectivity, all in the absence of cloud servers.
